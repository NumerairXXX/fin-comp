fin comp final project
Hooooray!

Today is the first day of our project! --Apr 15, 2017


### Branches
I have made a branch for each person. Here at GitHub, the developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready is other branches, they merge their branches into master. 
### How to merge our contributions into master
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
Feel free to try! -- Ning
